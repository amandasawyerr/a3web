<p class="p-spacing">SQjr has a team of remote sensing specialists for all your imagery needs.  Every one of our remote sensing technicians are certified drone pilots for advanced operations.  SQjr has a history of working with imagery from a variety of sources such as satellite, drone and arial photos from planes and helicopters.  Our surveying and remote sensing divisions routinely work together to produce high quality photogrammetry.  These 3D models have become a key component of land surveying and are used regularly by construction contractors, governments,  planners and architects.  The data received from photogrammetry is key to accurate and safe project planning.</p> 

<p>Our remote sensing team routinely pilots industry standard drones to produce high quality results for our customers.</p>
