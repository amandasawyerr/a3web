<p class="p-spacing">“To put a city in a book, to put the world on one sheet of paper -- maps are the most
condensed humanized spaces of all...They make the landscape fit indoors, make us
masters of sights we can't see and spaces we can't cover.”
- Robert Harbison, Eccentric Spaces</p>

<p class="p-spacing">“Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them
  standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the
  flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On
  their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming.
  Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In
  the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of
  mystery.” ― Cormac McCarthy, The Road </p>
  
<p class="p-spacing">“Well generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements
  while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way. The level
  of detail and importance in what is remaining on the map must outweigh the
  insignificance of items that were generalized, as to preserve the distinguishing
  characteristics of what makes the map useful and important.” from Jiang, B. Liu, X. &
  Jia, T. (2013). Scaling of geographic space as a universal rule for map
  generalization. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 4, 844-855.</p>

<p class="p-spacing">“....The technological advances that we are experiencing provide the potential for new and
  better map designs, but without proper cartographic education not only will map quality
  ultimately suffer but the geographic understanding that is obtained in practicing geographic
  cartography may be lost as well”
  Thomas W. Hodler, Urban Geography (1994)</p>
